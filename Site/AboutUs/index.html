            For our hackathon we got the assignment to try to fix a problem during this hard time caused by the Corona-Virus.
            During this time of quarantine, it's still important to go outside, which is difficult when we all try to stay away from eachother to not pass the virus along.
            You have to guess where less people are at a certain time and go check, which sometimes result into you going home dissapointed because there are too much people.

            With this site you can see if the place you are going is crowded, but for that infomation we need your help.
            You just have to say where, when and how long you're going to a place. Don't worry, the infomation stays anonymous.
            You can also add places. 
        </p>

            Working together, everyone can help eachother find an ideal public place to vist without risk of infection.
